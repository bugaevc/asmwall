# 404
There's nothing on this page - as in nothing except fot _this_ text, which is,
in fact, longer than content of most pages of this site (by the way,
you should check out our [cdecl explanation](?cdecl), which is pretty long too).

Now you've probably reached this page not because you've manually typed in some
incorrect URL (which is what I do to test this page). So if you read this it
probably means you've been given a wrong link, in which case you should do
the following:

* Head to [the main page](.) and look there for the thing the URL you've been
given _should be_ pointing to.
* If you got the wrong link from a private message (perhaps, a chat) you can
just post the correct link to show how attentive you are - before others do ;).
* If it's from some other page you probably should contact its author. Oh, and
if you _are_ the author of that page, go ahead and fix it - why do you even
need this explanation to figure that out?

If you think this page really should exist, feel free to contact us or even
write it yourself!
